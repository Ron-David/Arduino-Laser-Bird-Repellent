# Arduino-Laser-Bird-Repellent
Laser-Bird-Repellent is an IOT device that detects with the help of an ultrasonic sensor whether the pigeon is on the window and then activates a laser in its direction - the pigeon interprets the laser as an object moving toward its direction and therefore its natural reflex is to flee in panic, which will cause all pigeons near by to flee as well.

Requirements:
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Laser
- 2 Servos
- Wifi (optional) // I used NodeMCU as a wifi
- Wires
- Servo bracket
